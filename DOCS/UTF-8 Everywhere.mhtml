<h2 id=3D"intro"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#intro">Purpose of th=
is document</a></h2>

<aside>This document contains special characters. Without proper rendering =
support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols.</aside>

<p>Our goal is to promote usage and support of the UTF-8 encoding and to co=
nvince that it should be the default choice of encoding for storing text st=
rings in memory or on disk, for communication and all other uses. We believ=
e that our approach improves performance, reduces complexity of software an=
d helps prevent many Unicode-related bugs. We suggest that other encodings =
of Unicode (or text, in general) belong to rare edge-cases of optimization =
and should be avoided by mainstream users.</p>

<p>In particular, we believe that the very popular UTF-16 encoding (often m=
istakenly referred to as =E2=80=98widechar=E2=80=99 or simply =E2=80=98Unic=
ode=E2=80=99 in the Windows world) has no place in library APIs except for =
specialized text processing libraries, e.g. ICU.</p>

<p>This document also recommends choosing UTF-8 for internal string represe=
ntation in Windows applications, despite the fact that this standard is les=
s popular there, both due to historical reasons and the lack of native UTF-=
8 support by the API. We believe that, even on this platform, the following=
 arguments outweigh the lack of native support. Also, we recommend forgetti=
ng forever what =E2=80=98ANSI codepages=E2=80=99 are and what they were use=
d for. It is in the user=E2=80=99s bill of rights to mix any number of lang=
uages in any text string.</p>

<p>Across the industry, many localization-related bugs have been <a href=3D=
"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html" rel=3D"nofollow">blam=
ed</a> on programmers=E2=80=99 lack of knowledge in Unicode. We, however, b=
elieve that for an application that is not supposed to specialize in text, =
the infrastructure can and should make it possible for the program to be un=
aware of encoding issues. For instance, a file copy utility should not be w=
ritten differently to support non-English file names. In this manifesto, we=
 will also explain what a programmer should be doing if they do not want to=
 dive into all complexities of Unicode and do not really care about <a href=
=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#cookie">what=E2=80=99s inside the string</a>=
.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we would like to suggest that counting or otherwise iterati=
ng over Unicode code points should not be seen as a particularly important =
task in text processing scenarios. Many developers mistakenly see code poin=
ts as a kind of a successor to ASCII characters. This lead to software desi=
gn decisions such as Python=E2=80=99s string O(1) code point access. The tr=
uth, however, is that Unicode is inherently more complicated and there is n=
o universal definition of such thing as <em>Unicode character</em>. We see =
no particular reason to favor Unicode code points over Unicode grapheme clu=
sters, code units or perhaps even words in a language for that. On the othe=
r hand, seeing UTF-8 code units (bytes) as a basic unit of text seems parti=
cularly useful for many tasks, such as parsing commonly used textual data f=
ormats. This is due to a particular feature of this encoding. Graphemes, co=
de units, code points and other relevant Unicode terms are explained in <a =
href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#characters">Section=C2=A05</a>. Operatio=
ns on encoded text strings are discussed in <a href=3D"http://utf8everywher=
e.org/#textops">Section=C2=A07</a>.</p>

<h2 id=3D"background"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#background">Bac=
kground</a></h2>

<p>In 1988, Joseph D. Becker published the <a href=3D"http://unicode.org/hi=
story/unicode88.pdf">first Unicode draft proposal</a>. At the basis of his =
design was the na=C3=AFve assumption that 16 bits per character would suffi=
ce. In 1991, the first version of the Unicode standard was published, with =
code points limited to 16 bits. In the following years many systems have ad=
ded support for Unicode and switched to the UCS-2 encoding. It was especial=
ly attractive for new technologies, such as the Qt framework (1992), Window=
s NT 3.1 (1993) and Java (1995).</p>

<p>However, it was soon discovered that 16 bits per character will not do f=
or Unicode. In 1996, the UTF-16 encoding was created so existing systems wo=
uld be able to work with non-16-bit characters. This effectively nullified =
the rationale behind choosing 16-bit encoding in the first place, namely be=
ing a fixed-width encoding. Currently Unicode spans over 109449 characters,=
 about 74500 of them being CJK ideographs.</p>

<p>Microsoft has often mistakenly used =E2=80=98Unicode=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=
=98widechar=E2=80=99 as synonyms for both =E2=80=98UCS-2=E2=80=99 and =E2=
=80=98UTF-16=E2=80=99. Furthermore, since UTF-8 cannot be set as the encodi=
ng for narrow string WinAPI, one must compile his code with <code>UNICODE</=
code> define. Windows C++ programmers are educated that Unicode must be don=
e with =E2=80=98widechars=E2=80=99 (Or worse=E2=80=94the compiler setting-d=
ependent TCHARs, which allow programmer to opt-out from supporting all Unic=
ode code points). As a result of this mess, many Windows programmers are no=
w quite confused about what is the right thing to do about text.</p>

<p>At the same time, in the Linux and the Web worlds, there is a silent agr=
eement that UTF-8 is the best encoding to use for Unicode. Even though it p=
rovides shorter representation for English and therefore to computer langua=
ges (such as C++, HTML, XML, etc) over any other text, it is seldom less ef=
ficient than UTF-16 for commonly used character sets.</p>

<h2 id=3D"facts"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#facts">The facts</a>=
</h2>

<ul>
	<li>In both UTF-8 and UTF-16 encodings, code points may take up to 4 bytes=
.</li>

	<li>UTF-8 is endianness independent. UTF-16 comes in two flavors: UTF-16LE=
 and UTF-16BE (for the two different byte orders, respectively). Here we na=
me them collectively as UTF-16.</li>

	<li>Widechar is 2 bytes in size on some platforms, 4 on others.</li>

	<li>UTF-8 and UTF-32 yield the same order when sorted lexicographically. U=
TF-16 does not.</li>

	<li>UTF-8 favors efficiency for English letters and other ASCII characters=
 (one byte per character) while UTF-16 favors several Asian character sets =
(2 bytes instead of 3 in UTF-8). This is what made UTF-8 the favorite choic=
e in the Web world, where English HTML/XML tags are intermixed with any-lan=
guage text. Cyrillic, Hebrew and several other popular Unicode blocks are 2=
 bytes both in UTF-16 and UTF-8.</li>

	<li>UTF-16 is often misused as a fixed-width encoding, even by the Windows=
 package programs themselves: in plain Windows edit control (until Vista), =
it takes two backspaces to delete a character which takes 4 bytes in UTF-16=
. On Windows 7, the console displays such characters as two invalid charact=
ers, regardless of the font being used.</li>

	<li>Many third-party libraries for Windows do not support Unicode: they ac=
cept narrow string parameters and pass them to the ANSI API. Sometimes, eve=
n for file names. In the general case, it is impossible to work around this=
, as a string may not be representable completely in any ANSI code page (if=
 it contains characters from a mix of Unicode blocks). What is normally don=
e by Windows programmers for file names is getting an 8.3 path to the file =
(if it already exists) and feeding it into such a library. It is not possib=
le if the library is supposed to create a non-existing file. It is not poss=
ible if the path is very long and the 8.3 form is longer than <code>MAX_PAT=
H</code>. It is not possible if short-name generation is disabled in OS set=
tings.</li>

	<li>In C++, there is no way to return Unicode from <code>std::exception::w=
hat()</code> other than using UTF-8. There is no way to support Unicode for=
 <code>localeconv</code> other than using UTF-8.</li>

	<li>UTF-16 remains popular today, even outside the Windows world. Qt, Java=
, C#, Python (prior to the CPython v3.3 reference implementation, <a href=
=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.python">see below</a>) and the <a href=
=3D"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Components_for_Unicode">ICU<=
/a>=E2=80=94they all use UTF-16 for internal string representation.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id=3D"cookie"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#cookie">Opaque data=
 argument</a></h2>

<p>Let=E2=80=99s go back to the file copy utility. In the UNIX world, narro=
w strings are considered UTF-8 by default almost everywhere. Because of tha=
t, the author of the file copy utility would not need to care about Unicode=
. Once tested on ASCII strings for file name arguments, it would work corre=
ctly for file names in any language, as arguments are treated as <a href=3D=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_data_type">cookies</a>. The code of th=
e file copy utility would not need to change <em>at all</em> to support for=
eign languages. <code>fopen()</code> would accept Unicode seamlessly, and s=
o would <code>argv</code>.</p>

<p>Now let=E2=80=99s see how to do this on Microsoft Windows, a UTF-16 base=
d architecture. To make a file copy utility that can accept file names in a=
 mix of several different Unicode blocks (languages) here requires advanced=
 trickery. First, the application must be compiled as Unicode-aware. In thi=
s case, it cannot have <code>main()</code> function with standard-C paramet=
ers. It will then accept UTF-16 encoded <code>argv</code>. To convert a Win=
dows program written with narrow text in mind to support Unicode, one has t=
o refactor deep and to take care of each and every string variable.</p>

<p>The standard library shipped with MSVC is poorly implemented with respec=
t to Unicode support. It forwards narrow-string parameters directly to the =
OS ANSI API. There is no way to override this. Changing <code>std::locale</=
code> does not work. It=E2=80=99s impossible to open a file with a Unicode =
name on MSVC using standard features of C++. The standard way to open a fil=
e is:</p>

<pre>std::fstream fout("abc.txt");</pre>

<p>The proper way to get around is by using Microsoft=E2=80=99s own hack th=
at accepts wide-string parameter, which is a non-standard extension.</p>

<p>On Windows, the <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Nls\CodePage=
\ACP</code> registry key enables receiving non-ASCII characters, but only f=
rom a single ANSI codepage. An unimplemented value of 65001 would probably =
resolve the cookie issue, on Windows. If Microsoft implements support of th=
is <abbr title=3D"ANSI Code Page">ACP</abbr> value, this will help wider ad=
option of UTF-8 on Windows platform.</p>

<p>For Windows programmers and multi-platform library vendors, we further d=
iscuss our approach to handling text strings and refactoring programs for b=
etter Unicode support in the <a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#windows"=
>How to do text on Windows</a> section.</p>


<h2 id=3D"characters"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#characters">Gly=

<p>Here is an excerpt of the definitions regarding characters, code points,=
 code units and grapheme clusters according to the Unicode Standard with ou=
r comments. You are encouraged to refer to the relevant sections of the sta=
ndard for a more detailed description.</p>

s</em> do you see?</p></aside>

<ul>
	<li><p><b>Code point</b> =E2=80=94
	Any numerical value in the Unicode codespace.<sup>[=C2=A73.4, D10]</sup> F=
or instance: U+3243F. </p></li>

	<li><p><b>Code unit</b> =E2=80=94
	The minimal bit combination that can represent a unit of encoded text.<sup=
>[=C2=A73.9, D77]</sup> For example, UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 use 8-bit, 16=
-bit and 32-bit code units respectively. The above code point will be encod=
ed as four code units =E2=80=98<code>f0 b2 90 bf</code>=E2=80=99 in UTF-8, =
two code units =E2=80=98<code>d889 dc3f</code>=E2=80=99 in UTF-16 and as a =
single code unit =E2=80=98<code>0003243f</code>=E2=80=99 in UTF-32. Note th=
at these are just sequences of <em>groups of bits</em>; how they are stored=
 on an octet-oriented media depends on the endianness of the particular enc=
oding. When storing the above UTF-16 code units, they will be converted to =
=E2=80=98<code>d8 89 dc 3f</code>=E2=80=99 in UTF-16BE and to =E2=80=98<cod=
e>89 d8 3f dc</code>=E2=80=99 in UTF-16LE.</p></li>

	<li><p><b>Abstract character</b> =E2=80=94
	A unit of information used for the organization, control, or representatio=
n of textual data.<sup>[=C2=A73.4, D7]</sup> The standard further says in =
=C2=A73.1:</p>

	<blockquote><p>For the Unicode Standard, [...] the repertoire is inherentl=
y open. Because Unicode is a universal encoding, any abstract character tha=
t could ever be encoded is a potential candidate to be encoded, regardless =
of whether the character is currently known.</p></blockquote>

	<p>The definition is indeed abstract. Whatever one can think of as a chara=
cter=E2=80=94<em>is</em> an abstract character. For example, <img src=3D"ht=
tp://utf8everywhere.org/data/glyph-ungwe.png" style=3D"vertical-align: -1ex=
" alt=3D"" /> <em>tengwar letter ungwe</em> is an abstract character, altho=
ugh it is not yet representable in Unicode.</p></li>

	<li><p><b>Encoded character</b>, <b>Coded character</b> =E2=80=94
	A mapping between a code point and an abstract character.<sup>[=C2=A73.4, =
D11]</sup> For example, U+1F428 is a coded character which represents the a=
bstract character =F0=9F=90=A8 <span class=3D"uniname">koala</span>.</p>

	<p>This mapping is neither total, nor injective, nor surjective:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Surragates, noncharacters and unassigned code points do not correspon=
d to abstract characters at all.</li>
		<li>Some abstract characters can be encoded by different code points; U+0=
3A9 <span class=3D"uniname">greek capital letter omega</span> and U+2126 <s=
pan class=3D"uniname">ohm sign</span> both correspond to the same abstract =
character =E2=80=98=CE=A9=E2=80=99, and <em>must be treated identically</em=
>.</li>
		<li>Some abstract characters cannot be encoded by a single code point. Th=
ese are represented by <em>sequences</em> of coded characters. For example,=
 the only way to represent the abstract character =D1=8E=CC=81 <em>cyrillic=
 small letter yu with acute</em> is by the sequence U+044E <span class=3D"u=
niname">cyrillic small letter yu</span> followed by U+0301 <span class=3D"u=
niname">combining acute accent</span>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Moreover, for some abstract characters, there exist representations usi=
ng multiple code points, <em>in addition</em> to the single coded character=
 form. The abstract character =C7=B5 can be coded by the single code point =
U+01F5 <span class=3D"uniname">latin small letter g with acute</span>, or b=
y the sequence &lt;U+0067 <span class=3D"uniname">latin small letter g</spa=
n>, U+0301 <span class=3D"uniname">combining acute accent</span>&gt;.</p>
	</li>

	<li><p><b>User-perceived character</b> =E2=80=94
	Whatever the end user thinks of as a character. This notion is language de=
pendent. For instance, =E2=80=98ch=E2=80=99 is two letters in English and L=
atin, but considered to be one letter in Czech and Slovak.</p></li>

	<li><p><b>Grapheme cluster</b> =E2=80=94
	A sequence of coded characters that =E2=80=98should be kept together=E2=80=
=99.<sup>[=C2=A72.11]</sup> Grapheme clusters approximate the notion of use=
r-perceived characters in a language independent way. They are used for, e.=
g., cursor movement and selection.</p></li>

	<li><p><b>Glyph</b> =E2=80=94
	A particular shape within a font. Fonts are collections of glyphs designed=
 by a type designer. It=E2=80=99s the text shaping and rendering engine res=
ponsibility to convert a sequence of code points into a sequence of glyphs =
within the specified font. The rules for this conversion might be complicat=
ed, locale dependent, and are beyond the scope of the Unicode standard.</p>=
</li>
</ul>

<p>=E2=80=98Character=E2=80=99 may refer to any of the above. The Unicode S=
tandard uses it as a synonym for <em>coded character</em>.<sup>[=C2=A73.4]<=
/sup>
When a programming language or a library documentation says =E2=80=98charac=
ter=E2=80=99, it typically means a code unit. When an end user is asked abo=
ut the number of characters in a string, he will count the user-perceived c=
haracters. A programmer might count characters as code units, code points, =
or grapheme clusters, according to the level of the programmer=E2=80=99s Un=
icode expertise. For example, <a href=3D"https://developer.twitter.com/en/d=
ocs/basics/counting-characters.html">this is how Twitter counts characters<=
/a>. In our opinion, a string length function should not necessarily return=
 one for the string =E2=80=98=F0=9F=90=A8=E2=80=99 to be considered Unicode=
-compliant.</p>

<h2 id=3D"asian"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#asian">Asian texts: =
UTF-8 vs. UTF-16</a></h2>
<p>So, most Unicode code points take the same number of bytes in UTF-8 and =
in UTF-16. This includes Russian, Hebrew, Greek and all non-BMP code points=
 take 2 or 4 bytes in both encodings. Latin letters, together with punctuat=
ion marks and the rest of ASCII take more space in UTF-16, while some Asian=
 characters take more in UTF-8. Couldn=E2=80=99t Asian programmers, theoret=
ically, object dumping UTF-16=E2=80=94which saves them 50% of the memory pe=
r character?</p>

<p>Here=E2=80=99s reality. Saving half the memory is true only in artificia=
lly constructed examples containing only characters in the U+0800 to U+FFFF=
 range. However, computer-to-computer text interfaces dominate over all oth=
er usages of text. This includes XML, HTTP, filesystem paths and configurat=
ion files=E2=80=94they all use almost exclusively ASCII characters, and in =
fact UTF-8 is very popular in respective Asian countries.</p>

<p>For a dedicated storage of Chinese books, UTF-16 may still be used as a =
fair optimization. As soon as the text is retrieved from such storage, it s=
hould be converted to the standard compatible with the rest of the world. I=
n either case, if storage is at premium, a lossless compression will be use=
d. In such cases, UTF-8 and UTF-16 will take roughly the same space. Furthe=
rmore, =E2=80=98in the said languages, a glyph conveys more information tha=

">UTF-16 considered harmful</a>).</p>

<p>Here are the results of a simple experiment. The space used by the HTML =
source of some web page (<em>Japan</em> article, retrieved from the Japanes=
e Wikipedia on 2012=E2=80=9301=E2=80=9301) is shown in the first column. Th=

<p>As can be seen, UTF-16 takes about 50% more space than UTF-8 on real dat=
a, it only saves 20% for dense Asian text, and hardly competes with general=
 purpose compression algorithms. The <a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/z=
h-cn">Chinese translation</a> of this manifesto takes 58.8 KiB in UTF-16, a=
nd only 51.7 KiB in UTF-8.</p>

<h2 id=3D"textops"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#textops">Text oper=
ations on encoded strings</a></h2>

<p>The popular text-based data formats (e.g. CSV, XML, HTML, JSON, RTF and =
source codes of computer programs) often contain ASCII characters as struct=
ure control elements and may contain both ASCII and non-ASCII text data str=
ings. Working with a variable length encoding, where ASCII-inherited code p=
oints are shorter than other code points may seem like a difficult task, be=
cause encoded character boundaries within the string are not immediately kn=
own. This has driven software architects to opt for UCS-4 fixed-width encod=
ing. (e.g. <a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.python">Python v3.3</a=
>). In fact, this is both unnecessary and does not solve any real problem w=
e know.</p>

<p>By design of this encoding, UTF-8 guarantees that an ASCII character val=
ue or a substring will never match a part of a multi-byte encoded character=
. The same is true for UTF-16. In both encodings, the code units of multi-p=
art encoded code point will have <abbr title=3D"Most Significant Bit">MSB</=
abbr> set to 1.</p>

<p>To find, say, =E2=80=98&lt;=E2=80=99 sign marking a beginning of an HTML=
 tag, or an apostrophe (') in a UTF-8 encoded SQL statement to defend again=
st an SQL injection, do as you would for an all-English plaintext ASCII str=
ing. The encoding guarantees this to work. Specifically, that every non-ASC=
II character is encoded in UTF-8 as a sequence of bytes, each of them havin=
g a value greater than 127. This leaves no place for collision for a na=C3=
=AFve algorithm=E2=80=94simple, fast and elegant, and no need to care about=
 encoded character boundaries.</p>

<p>Also, you can search for a non-ASCII, UTF-8 encoded substring in a UTF-8=
 string as if it was a plain byte array=E2=80=94there is no need to mind co=
de point boundaries. This is thanks to another design feature of UTF-8=E2=
=80=94a leading byte of an encoded code point can never hold value correspo=
nding to one of trailing bytes of any other code point.</p>

<p>As we already noted, there is a popular idea that counting, splitting, i=
ndexing or otherwise iterating over code points in a Unicode string should =
be considered a frequent and important operation. In this section, we revie=
w this in further detail.</p>

<h3 id=3D"myth.utf16.o1"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#myth.utf16.o=
1">Counting characters can be done in constant time with UTF-16.</a></h3>

<p>This is a common mistake by those who think that UTF-16 is a fixed-width=
 encoding. It is not. In fact UTF-16 is a variable length encoding. Refer t=
o <a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.almostfw">this FAQ</a> if you d=
eny the existence of non-BMP characters.</p>

<h3 id=3D"myth.utf32.o1"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#myth.utf32.o=
1">Counting characters can be done in constant time with UTF-32.</a></h3>

<p>This depends on the meaning of the misused word =E2=80=98character=E2=80=
=99. It is true that we can count code units and code points in constant ti=
me in UTF-32. However, code points do not correspond to user-perceived char=
acters. Even in the Unicode formalism some code points correspond to <em>co=
ded character</em> and some to <em>non-characters</em>.</p>

<h3 id=3D"myth.strlen"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#myth.strlen">C=
ounting coded characters or code points is important.</a></h3>

<p>We think that the importance of code points is frequently overstated. Th=
is is due to common misunderstanding of the complexity of Unicode, which me=
rely reflects the complexity of human languages. It is easy to tell how man=
y characters are there in =E2=80=98Abracadabra=E2=80=99, but let=E2=80=99s =
go back to the following string:</p>

<p class=3D"display">=D0=9F=D1=80=D0=B8=D0=B2=D0=B5=CC=81=D1=82 =E0=A4=A8=
=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=87 =D7=A9=D6=B8=D7=81=D7=9C=D7=
=95=D6=B9=D7=9D</p>

<p>It consists of 22 (!) code points, but only 16 grapheme clusters. It may=
 be reduced to 20 code points if converted to <a href=3D"http://unicode.org=
/reports/tr15/">NFC</a>. Yet, the number of code points in it is irrelevant=
 to almost any software engineering task, with perhaps the only exception o=
f converting the string to UTF-32. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For cursor movement, text selection and alike, <em>grapheme clusters</=
em> shall be used. <!-- 5.11 --></li>

	<li>For limiting the length of a string in input fields, file formats, pro=
tocols, or databases, the length is measured in <em>code units</em> of some=
 predetermined encoding. The reason is that any length limit is derived fro=
m the fixed amount of memory allocated for the string at a lower level, be =
it in memory, disk or in a particular data structure.</li>

	<li>The size of the string as it appears on the screen is unrelated to the=
 number of code points in the string. One has to communicate with the rende=
ring engine for this. Code points do not occupy one column even in monospac=
e fonts and terminals. POSIX takes this into account. <!-- POSIX, 3.103 Col=
umn Position --></li>
</ul>

<h3 id=3D"myth.nfc"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#myth.nfc">In NFC =
each code point corresponds to one user-perceived character.</a></h3>

<p>No, because the number of user-perceived characters that can be represen=
ted in Unicode is virtually infinite. Even in practice, most characters do =
not have a fully composed form. For example, the NFD string from the exampl=
e above, which consists of three <em>real</em> words in three <em>real</em>=
 languages, will consist of 20 code points in NFC. This is still far more t=
han the 16 user-perceived characters it has.</p>

<h3 id=3D"myth.strlen.correctness"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#my=
th.strlen.correctness">The string <code>length()</code> operation must coun=
t user-perceived or coded characters. If not, it does not support Unicode p=
roperly.</a></h3>

<p>Unicode support of libraries and programming languages is frequently jud=
ged by the value returned for the =E2=80=98length of the string=E2=80=99 op=
eration. According to this evaluation of Unicode support, most popular lang=
uages, such as C#, Java, and even the ICU itself, would not support Unicode=
. For example, the length of the one character string =E2=80=98=F0=9F=90=A8=
=E2=80=99 will be often reported to be 2 where UTF-16 is used as for the in=
ternal string representation and 4 for the languages that internally use UT=
F-8. The source of the misconception is that the specification of these lan=
guages use the word =E2=80=98character=E2=80=99 to mean a code unit, while =
the programmer expects it to be something else.</p>

<p>That said, the code unit count returned by those APIs is of the highest =
practical importance. When writing a UTF-8 string to a file, it is the leng=
th in bytes which is important. Counting any other type of =E2=80=98charact=
ers=E2=80=99 is, on the other hand, not very helpful.</p>

<h2 id=3D"conclusions"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#conclusions">O=
ur conclusions</a></h2>

<p>UTF-16 is the worst of both worlds, being both variable length and too w=
ide. It exists only for historical reasons and creates a lot of confusion. =
We hope that its usage will further decline.</p>

<p>Portability, cross-platform interoperability and simplicity are more imp=
ortant than interoperability with existing platform APIs. So, the best appr=
oach is to use UTF-8 narrow strings everywhere and convert them back and fo=
rth when using platform APIs that don=E2=80=99t support UTF-8 and accept wi=
de strings (e.g. Windows API). <a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.cv=
t.perf">Performance is seldom an issue</a> of any relevance when dealing wi=
th string-accepting system APIs (e.g. UI code and file system APIs), and th=
ere is a great advantage to using the same encoding everywhere else in the =
application, so <a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.liberal">we see n=
o sufficient reason to do otherwise</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of performance, machines often use strings to communicate (e.g.=
 HTTP headers, XML, SOAP). Many see this as a mistake by itself, but regard=
less of that it is nearly always done in English and ASCII, giving UTF-8 fu=
rther advantage there. Using different encodings for different kinds of str=
ings significantly increases complexity and resulting bugs.</p>

<p>In particular, we believe that adding <code>wchar_t</code> to the C++ st=
andard was a mistake, and so are the Unicode additions to C++11. What must =
be demanded from the implementations though, is that the <em>basic executio=
n character set</em> would be capable of storing any Unicode data. Then, ev=
ery <code>std::string</code> or <code>char*</code> parameter would be Unico=
de-compatible. =E2=80=98If this accepts text, it should be Unicode compatib=
le=E2=80=99=E2=80=94and with UTF-8, it is easy to achieve.</p>

<p><a href=3D"http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/locale/doc/html/rat=
ionale.html">The standard facets have many design flaws</a>. This includes =
<code>std::numpunct</code>, <code>std::moneypunct</code> and <code>std::cty=
pe</code> not supporting variable-length encoded characters (non-ASCII UTF-=
8 and non-BMP UTF-16), or not having the information to perform the convers=
ions. They must be fixed:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>decimal_point()</code> and <code>thousands_sep()</code> shall re=
turn a string rather than a single code unit. This is how C locales do this=
 through the <code>localeconv</code> function, albeit not customizable.</li=
>

	<li><code>toupper()</code> and <code>tolower()</code> shall not be phrased=
 in terms of code units, as it does not work in Unicode. For example, the L=
atin =EF=AC=84 ligature must be converted to FFL and the German =C3=9F to S=
S (there is a capital form =E1=BA=9E, but the casing rules follow the tradi=
tional ones). In addition, some languages (e.g. Greek) have special final f=
orms of some lower case letters, so case conversion routines must be aware =
of their position to perform the conversion correctly.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id=3D"windows"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#windows">How to do=
 text on Windows</a></h2>

<p>This section is dedicated to developing multi-platform library developme=
nt and to Windows programming. The problem with Windows platform is that it=
 does not (yet) support Unicode-compatible narrow string system APIs. The o=
nly way to pass Unicode strings to Windows API is by converting to UTF-16 (=
also known as wide strings).</p>

<p>Note that our guidelines differ significantly from the Microsoft=E2=80=
=99s original guide to Unicode conversion. Our approach based on performing=
 the wide string conversion as close to API calls as possible, and never ho=
lding wide string data. In the previous sections we explained that this wil=
l typically result in better performance, stability, code simplicity and in=
teroperability with other software.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Do not use <code>wchar_t</code> or <code>std::wstring</code> in any pl=
ace other than adjacent point to APIs accepting UTF-16.</li>

	<li>Do not use <code>_T("")</code> or <code>L""</code> literals in any pla=
ce other than parameters to APIs accepting UTF-16.</li>

	<li>Do not use types, functions, or their derivatives that are sensitive t=
o the <code>UNICODE</code> constant, such as <code>LPTSTR</code>, <code>Cre=
ateWindow()</code> or the <code>_T()</code>macro. Instead, use <code>LPWSTR=
</code>, <code>CreateWindowW()</code> and explicit <code>L""</code> literal=
s.</li>

	<li>Yet, <code>UNICODE</code> and <code>_UNICODE</code> are always defined=
, to avoid passing narrow UTF-8 strings to ANSI WinAPI getting silently com=
piled. This can be done by VS project settings, under code name <em>Use Uni=
code character set</em>.</li>

	<li><code>std::string</code> and <code>char*</code> variables are consider=
ed UTF-8, anywhere in the program.</li>

	<li>If you have the privilege of writing in C++, the <code>narrow()</code>=
/<code>widen()</code> conversion functions below can be handy for inline co=
nversion syntax. Of course, any other UTF-8/UTF-16 coversion code would do.=
</li>

	<li>
		<p>Only use Win32 functions that accept widechars (<code>LPWSTR</code>), =
never those which accept <code>LPTSTR</code> or <code>LPSTR</code>. Pass pa=
rameters this way:</p>
		<pre>::SetWindowTextW(widen(someStdString or "string litteral").c_str())<=
/pre>
		<p>The policy uses conversion functions described below. See also, <a hre=
f=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.cvt.perf">a note on conversion performa=
nce</a>.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<p>With MFC strings:</p>
		<pre>CString someoneElse; // something that arrived from MFC.

// Converted as soon as possible, before passing any further away from the =
API call:
std::string s =3D str(boost::format("Hello %s\n") % narrow(someoneElse));
AfxMessageBox(widen(s).c_str(), L"Error", MB_OK);</pre>
	</li>

	<li>For .NET developers: using the native UTF-16 based string class may be=
 hard to avoid. Remember that this implementation detail leaks heavily thro=
ugh the interface of this class. For example, <code>string[index]</code> op=
eration may return part of a character (as it would be with a UTF-8 byte ar=
ray). When serializing strings into output files or communication devices, =
remember to specify <code>Encoding.UTF8</code>. Be ready to pay the perform=
ance penalities for conversion, e.g. in ASP.NET web applications, which typ=
ically generate UTF-8 HTML output.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=3D"how.files"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#how.files">Worki=
ng with files, filenames and fstreams on Windows</a></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Always produce text output files in UTF-8.</li>

	<li>Using <code>fopen()</code> should anyway be avoided for <a href=3D"htt=
p://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAII">RAII/OOD</a> reasons. However, if necessary=
, use <code>_wfopen()</code> and WinAPI conventions as described above.</li=
>

	<li>Never pass <code>std::string</code> or <code>const char*</code> filena=
me arguments to the <code>fstream</code> family. MSVC CRT does not support =
UTF-8 arguments, but it has a non-standard extension which should be used a=
s follows:</li>

	<li>
		<p>Convert <code>std::string</code> arguments to <code>std::wstring</code=
> with <code>widen</code>:</p>
		<pre>std::ifstream ifs(widen("hello"), std::ios_base::binary);</pre>
		<p>We will have to manually remove the conversion, when MSVC=E2=80=99s at=
titude to <code>fstream</code> changes.</p>
	</li>

	<li>This code is not multi-platform and may have to be changed manually in=
 the future.</li>

	<li>Alternatively use a set of wrappers that hide the conversions.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id=3D"how.cvt"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#how.cvt">Conversio=
n functions</a></h3>

<p>This guideline uses the conversion functions from the <a href=3D"http://=
cppcms.com/files/nowide/html/">Boost.Nowide library</a> (it is not yet a pa=
rt of boost):</p>

<pre>std::string narrow(const wchar_t *s);
std::wstring widen(const char *s);
std::string narrow(const std::wstring &amp;s);
std::wstring widen(const std::string &amp;s);</pre>

<p>The library also provides a set of wrappers for commonly used standard C=
 and C++ library functions that deal with files, as well as means of readin=
g and writing UTF-8 through iostreams.</p>

<p>These functions and wrappers are easy to implement using Windows=E2=80=
=99 <code>MultiByteToWideChar</code> and <code>WideCharToMultiByte</code> f=
unctions. Any other (possibly faster) conversion routines can be used.</p>

<p>A: No, I grew up on Windows, and I am primarily a Windows developer. I b=

<p>A: No, and my country is non-ASCII speaking. I do not think that using a=

 has anything to do with human interaction. Even though one can argue that =
source codes of programs, web pages and XML files, OS file names and other =

>Q: Why do you guys care? I program in C# and/or Java and I don=E2=80=99t n=
eed to care about encodings at all.</a></h3>
<p>A: This is false. Both C# and Java offer a 16 bit <code>char</code> type=
, which is less than a Unicode character, congratulations. The .NET indexer=
 <code>str[i]</code> works in units of the internal representation, hence a=
 leaky abstraction once again. Substring methods will happily return an inv=
alid string, cutting a non-BMP character in parts.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you have to mind encodings when you are writing your text t=
o files on disk, network communications, external devices, or any place for=
 other program to read from. Please be kind to use <code>System.Text.Encodi=
ng.UTF8</code> (.NET) in these cases, never <code>Encoding.ASCII</code>, UT=
F-16 or cellphone PDU, regardless of the assumptions about the contents.</p=
>

<p>Web frameworks like ASP.NET do suffer from the poor choice of internal s=
tring representation in the underlying framework: the expected string outpu=
t (and input) of a web application is nearly always UTF-8, resulting in sig=
nificant conversion overhead in high-throughput web applications and web se=

 other.</p>

ters?</a></h3>
<p>A: Are you serious about not supporting all of Unicode in your software =
design? And, if you are going to support it anyway, how does the fact that =
non-BMP characters are rare practically change anything, except for making =
software testing harder? What does matter, however, is that text manipulati=

<h3 id=3D"faq.liberal"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.liberal">Q=
: Why not just let any programmer use their favorite encoding internally, a=
s long as they knows how to use it?</a></h3>
<p>A: We have nothing against correct usage of any encoding. However, it be=
comes a problem when the same type, such as <code>std::string</code>, means=
 different things in different contexts. While it is =E2=80=98ANSI codepage=
=E2=80=99 for some, for others, it means =E2=80=98this code is broken and d=

 The result is lots of Unicode-broken software, industry-wide. JoelOnSoftwa=
re <a href=3D"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html" rel=3D"n=

<p>This is a valid shortcut. Indeed, it may be a legitimate case for using =

<p>A: This is an additional safety mechanism against plugging a UTF-8 <code=

We want it to generate a compiler error. It is the same kind of a hard-to-f=

<p>A: Let=E2=80=99s first see when they start supporting <code>CP_UTF8</cod=

<p>Some say that adding <code>CP_UTF8</code> support would <em>break</em> e=

e reason why Microsoft had to resort to creating the wide string API. This =
is not true. Even some popular ANSI encodings are variable length (Shift JI=
S, for example), so no correct code would become broken. The reason Microso=

<p>Byte order issues are yet another reason to avoid UTF-16. UTF-8 has no e=

>Q: Won=E2=80=99t the conversions between UTF-8 and UTF-16 when passing str=

<p>A: First, you will do <em>some</em> conversion either way. It=E2=80=99s =
either when calling the system, or when interacting with the rest of the wo=
rld, e.g. when sending a text string over TCP. Also, those of OS APIs which=
 accept strings often perform tasks which are inherently slow, such as UI o=
r file system operations. If your interaction with the system APIs dominate=
 your application, here is a little experiment.</p>

<p>One typical use of the OS APIs is to open files. This function executes =
in (184=E2=80=89=C2=B1=E2=80=893)=CE=BCs on my machine:</p>

<pre>void f(const wchar_t* name)
{
    HANDLE f =3D CreateFile(name, GENERIC_WRITE, FILE_SHARE_READ, 0, CREATE=
_ALWAYS, 0, 0);
    DWORD written;
    WriteFile(f, "Hello world!\n", 13, &amp;written, 0);
    CloseHandle(f);
}</pre>

<p>While this runs in (186=E2=80=89=C2=B1=E2=80=890.7)=CE=BCs:</p>

<pre>void f(const char* name)
{
    HANDLE f =3D CreateFile(widen(name).c_str(), GENERIC_WRITE, FILE_SHARE_=
READ, 0, CREATE_ALWAYS, 0, 0);
    DWORD written;
    WriteFile(f, "Hello world!\n", 13, &amp;written, 0);

<p>This is just (1=E2=80=89=C2=B1=E2=80=892)% overhead. Also, <code>MultiBy=

<h3 id=3D"faq.literal"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.literal">Q=
: How do I write UTF-8 string literal in my C++ code?</a></h3>

<p>A: If you internationalize your software then all non-ASCII strings will=
 be loaded from an external translation database, so it is not a problem.</=
p>

<p>If you still want to embed a special character you can do it as follows.=
 In C++11 you can do it as:</p>

<p class=3D"display"><code>u8"=E2=88=83y =E2=88=80x =C2=AC(x =E2=89=BA y)"<=
/code></p>

<p>With compilers that do not support =E2=80=98u8=E2=80=99 you can hard-cod=
e the UTF-8 code units as follows:</p>

<p class=3D"display"><code>"\xE2\x88\x83y \xE2\x88\x80x \xC2\xAC(x \xE2\x89=
\xBA y)"</code></p>

<p>However the most straightforward way is to just write the string as-is a=
nd save the source file encoded in UTF-8:</p>

<p class=3D"display"><code>"=E2=88=83y =E2=88=80x =C2=AC(x =E2=89=BA y)"</c=
ode></p>

<p>Unfortunately, MSVC converts it to some ANSI codepage, corrupting the st=
ring. To work around this, save the file in UTF-8 <em>without BOM</em>. MSV=
C will assume that it is in the correct codepage and will not touch your st=
rings. However, it renders it impossible to use Unicode identifiers and wid=
e string literals (that you will not be using anyway).</p>

<h3 id=3D"faq.convert"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.convert">Q=
: I have a complex large char-based Windows application. What is the easies=
t way to make it Unicode-aware?</a></h3>
<p>Keep the chars. Define <code>UNICODE</code> and <code>_UNICODE</code> to=
 get compiler errors where <code>narrow()</code>/<code>widen()</code> shoul=
d be used (this is done automatically by setting <strong>Use Unicode Charac=
ter Set</strong> in Visual Studio project settings). Find all <code>fstream=
</code> and <code>fopen()</code> uses, and use wide overloads as described =
above. By now, you are almost done.</p>
<p>If you use 3rd-party libraries that do not support Unicode, e.g. forward=
ing file name strings as-is to <code>fopen()</code>, you will have to work =
around with tools such as <code>GetShortPathName()</code> as shown above.</=
p>

<h3 id=3D"faq.python"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.python">Q: =
What about Python? I heard they worked hard in v3.3 to support Unicode bett=
er.</a></h3>
<p>A: Perhaps, they should have done less and the support would have been b=
etter. In the CPython v3.3 reference implementation, the internal string re=
presentation was changed. The UTF-16 was replaced by one of three possible =
encodings (ISO-8859-1, UCS-2 or UCS-4) depending on the actual string conte=
nt. To add a single non-ASCII or non-BMP character, the entire string will =
often be implicitly converted to a different encoding. The internal encodin=
g is transparent to the script. This design is meant to <em>optimize the pe=
rformance of indexing operations</em> on Unicode code points. However, we a=
rgue that counting or indexing code points <a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere=
.org/#myth.strlen">should not be important</a> for the majority of uses=E2=
=80=94compared, for instance, to grapheme clusters. To our knowledge, Pytho=
n currently provides no support of the latter.</p>

<p>Therefore, we oppose representation-agnostic handling of strings, in fav=
or of representation-transparent API with a UTF-8 internal representation. =
Indexing operations would be counting code units rather than the code point=
s, as they in fact did before the change. This would also simplify the impl=
ementation and also improve performance, e.g. in scripts dealing with the W=
eb, which is already dominated by UTF-8 encoded text, thus making the Pytho=
n programming language more applicable in the server-side world. One may ar=
gue about the safety of string-cutting operations by script programmers, bu=
t then again, the same argument is valid for splitting grapheme clusters. E=
ven though Unicode is now fully supported, we believe that Python, as a mod=
ern tool with less historical burden to carry, must do better job in text h=
andling.</p>

<p>Other than that, JPython and IronPython continue to rely on the less for=
tunate encoding used by their hosting platforms (Java and .NET, respectivel=
y) and care must be taken to handle the surrogate pairs correctly there.</p=
>

<h3 id=3D"faq.ood"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.ood">Q: But wh=
y <code>std::string</code>? Wouldn=E2=80=99t it be a better, object-oriente=
d approach to have a UTF-8 aware string class?</a></h3>
<p>A: Not every piece of code dealing with strings is actually involved in =
processing and validation of text. A file copy program which receives Unico=
de file names and passes them to file IO routines, would do just fine with =
a simple byte buffer. If you design a library that accepts strings, the sim=
ple, standard and lightweight <code>std::string</code> would do just fine. =
On the contrary, it would be a mistake to reinvent a new string class and f=
orce everyone through your peculiar interface. Of course, if one needs more=
 than just passing strings around, he should then use appropriate text proc=
essing tools. However, such tools are better to be independent of the stora=
ge class used, in the spirit of the container/algorithm separation in the S=
TL. In fact, <a href=3D"http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/084.htm">some consider</a> =
<code>std::string</code> interface too bloated, as most of it was better to=
 be moved out of the <code>std::string</code> class.</p>

<h3 id=3D"faq.whats.now"><a href=3D"http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.whats.no=
w">Q: I already use this approach and I want to make our vision come true. =
What can I do?</a></h3>
<p>A: Spread the word.</p>
<p>Review your code and see what library is most painful to use in portable=
 Unicode-aware code. Open a bug report to the authors. If you are a C or C+=
+ library author, use <code>char*</code> and <code>std::string</code> with =
UTF-8 implied, and refuse to support ANSI code pages=E2=80=94since they are=
 inherently Unicode-broken.</p>
<p>If you are a Microsoft employee, push for implementing support of the <c=
ode>CP_UTF8</code> as one of narrow API code pages.</p>
<p>Further ideas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create a repository for patches of commonly used 3rd-party libraries f=
or UTF-8 support (e.g. PugiXML, LibTIFF, etc.) These are written in standar=
d C and do not care about Windows.</li>
	<li>Create a link-time patch for standard library functions (e.g. <code>fo=
pen()</code>) on Windows, which would do the proper parameter conversion. T=
his can be done for <code>main()</code> and the global environment variable=
s.</li>
</ul>
