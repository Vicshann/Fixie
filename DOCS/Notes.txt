/* Memory allocations:
Hard faults are what you are thinking of - these are where data is not in RAM and has to pulled in from the swap file. 
They cripple performance (being 10 000's of times slower than RAM access for mechanical hard drives).

Soft faults, however, are triggered by pages that the program requests to be zero (demand zero pages), 
when a page is written to for the first time (if it was a copy on write page) or if the page is already in memory 
somewhere else (usually when shared between multiple processes). These are not so bad for performance.

 TODO: Push/Pop states (State+PUSH; POP+State)   // Will allow kind of functions for the state machine (Helps with parsing of numbers)    ?????????   TODO: Move to some state machine

// LinkedList: Less excess operations but many cache misses(But equal perfamance for a CPU wilh a small cache)
//        PRO: Fast sorted insertion(No memory movement required as for arrays)
//        CON: Slow sequential access(Cache misses)
//  Good for StringPool, when strings are owned by some objects and accessed through them
//

It is slightly biased towards sacrificing memory for perfomance.

Note: Codegen in MSVC mode is broken. It won't generate POPCNT even if Arch:AVX2

Use "/clang: -msse4.2" or "/clang: -mpopcnt" specifically to override all that compatibility nonsense.
TODO: Make VS to use the provided compilation scripts but keep PDB debug info somehow.

NMyObj  / MyObj  - Grouping object (namespace). Only static members
CMyObj  - Have some nonstatic members and requires some initialization(A constructor, Init function)
SMyObj  - A simple struct, usually POD. May have couple of simple static/nonstatic member functions. Usually does not requires initialization or it is a simple memset.
